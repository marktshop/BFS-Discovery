The honest intent was to communicate that we're using the latest technology that shopify offers in terms of creating bundles... to have it all taken away from us for a listing image that was written in good intent is a little harsh. Taking the Built for Shopify badge severely impacts our peak season and throws all our scaling efforts over the last months down the drain."*
